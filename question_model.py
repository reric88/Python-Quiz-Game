# Step 1: Create a question Model (Class)

# Create a class that can be used as a constructor to build new questions

class Question:
    # Use the __init__ dunder method to indicate the function is a constructor
    # Set up two attributes for the question text and answer
    def __init__(self, q_text, q_answer):
        # Be sure to use the 'self' syntax to be able to refer back to the object to access the attributes later
        self.text = q_text
        self.answer = q_answer

# Test to make sure it is functioning properly
# new_q = Question('Are you ready for this quiz?', 'False')
# print(new_q)
